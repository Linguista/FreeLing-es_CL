**Linguistic resources for adapting FreeLing to Chilean Spanish**

[FreeLing](https://github.com/TALP-UPC/FreeLing) in an open source tool for performing natural language processing on a variety of languages. Among other things it lemmatizes, chunks and morphologically tags orthographic text.

This repository contains a series of resources I've developed to make FreeLing work better with Chilean Spanish.

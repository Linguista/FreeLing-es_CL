In these two files (`CL.vaux.Vos-V` and `CL.verb.Vos-V`), all verbs conjugated using the Chilean *voseo* paradigm have POS codes which end in "V" (rather than "0") in order to distinguish them from the t√∫ forms of the verbs, which otherwise would have identical tags.

You **must choose** between (a) using these two verb files and (b) using the `CL.vaux` and `CL.verb` files from the `entries` directory, as they contain the same word forms and lemmas, but different tags (the ones in the `entries` directory contain voseo tags ending in "0"). If you use all four files, FreeLing will flip out, assuming it doesn't have a check that prevents it from running at all in this situation.

In these two files (`CL.vaux.Vos-V` and `CL.verb.Vos-V`), all verbs conjugated using the Chilean *voseo* paradigm have POS codes which end in "V" (rather than "0") in order to distinguish them from the *tuteo* forms of the verbs, which otherwise would have identical tags and thus be indistinguishable from each other. Note that these are not licit EAGLES tags, and FreeLing will throw an error when assigning them, but this has no effect on the actual tagging as far as I can tell.

You **must choose** between using (a) these two verb files or (b) the `CL.vaux` and `CL.verb` files from the `entries` directory, as they contain the same word forms and lemmas, but different tags (the ones in the `entries` directory contain voseo tags ending in "0"). If you use all four files, FreeLing will flip out, assuming it doesn't have a check that prevents it from running at all in this situation.

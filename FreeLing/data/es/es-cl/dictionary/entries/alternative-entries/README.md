In these three files (`CL.vaux.Vos-V`, `CL.verb.Vos-V` and `CL.tanc.Vos-V`), all verbs conjugated using the Chilean *voseo* paradigm have POS codes which end in "V" (rather than "0") in order to distinguish them from the *tuteo* forms of the verbs, which otherwise would have identical tags and thus be indistinguishable from each other. The pronoun "vos" also has a "V" value in the final slot. Note that these are not standard EAGLES tags, and FreeLing will throw an error when assigning them unless you use the modified tagset.dat file. Note, however, that this has no effect on the actual tagging as far as I can tell.

You **must choose** between using (a) these three files or (b) the `CL.vaux`, `CL.verb` and `CL.tanc` files from the `entries` directory, as both sets of files contain the same word forms and lemmas, but different tags (the ones in the `entries` directory contain voseo tags ending in "0"). If you use all six files, FreeLing will flip out, assuming it doesn't have a check that prevents it from running at all in this situation.

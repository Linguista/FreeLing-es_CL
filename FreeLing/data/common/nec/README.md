# Chilean cities.dat files

`cities-CL.dat` contains a list of Chilean municipalities, provinces and regions, and nothing more.

`cities.dat` contains the Chilean list *plus* the standard FreeLing list, which contains location names from all over the world. This is the file that will be of most use to most users. I can think of no case in which users would benefit from using `cities-CL.dat`.
